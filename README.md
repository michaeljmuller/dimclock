This is a clock application for iPhone that turns off the backlight.  The API that turns off the backlight is not a public API, so there are no clock apps in the app store with this feature.  It also displays the weather.

I wrote this back in the iOS 3 / XCode 3 days.  I've converted the project to XCode 4.2 and iOS 5, but not really done much else to maintain it since then.

I don't remember where I got the image files, so there's a good chance they're not available for free public use.
